//Stripping Names: Store a personâ€™s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name.
// Use "\t" (tab) and "\n" (new line) at least once.
// Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. 
//Then print the name after stripping the white spaces.

console.log(myName); //name with whitespace
console.log(myName.trim());
// .trim() method is used to remove whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, newlines, etc.) from both ends of a string.
